### Tell us a bit about yourself

I’m a Senior Software Engineer with around 5 years of experience working in backend development, mainly focusing on Python, PSQL, JavaScript, Microservices, and REST API development.

What excites me is creating solutions that have a real-world impact. I enjoy tackling challenges head-on and continually improving processes. My experience mentoring team members and enhancing code quality aligns perfectly with this role. I bring a strong ability to think systematically and lead improvements that make a lasting impact.

### Tell me About a Time You Made a Mistake?

Early in my career, I misjudged the complexity of a data migration task during a project, which led to delays in the rollout. I underestimated the amount of data that needed to be processed and didn't account for certain dependencies between services.

Once I realized the mistake, I took responsibility and worked closely with my team to resolve it. I communicated the issue to stakeholders and adjusted our approach by implementing a more efficient data migration strategy. This taught me the importance of thorough planning and considering all aspects of a task, especially dependencies. Since then, I've always been more detailed in my planning and have learned to dive deeper before starting any task.

### Tell me About a Time You Worked on a Team?

While working on a fraud detection project at Xyz, our team faced significant pressure to improve the ACH payments infrastructure. I worked closely with my colleagues, often staying late to provide support, and collaborated on real-time alerts for stakeholders to prevent fraudulent activity. In the end, we prevented over $400k in fraud, which was a huge success for both the team and the company. I ensured everyone was aligned and supported, boosting morale and ensuring a smooth process. This experience reinforced the importance of teamwork and communication under pressure.

### Tell me About a Challenge You Faced at Work, and How You Overcame It?

A major challenge I faced was optimizing the performance of large-scale PDF exports (up to 1,000 pages) within strict time constraints. Initially, our solution was taking far too long—over 10 minutes—which impacted user experience.

I took ownership of the issue and dove deep into the codebase, identifying inefficiencies in the data handling and image rendering processes. After optimizing the logic and restructuring certain aspects of the export function, I reduced the processing time to under 4.5 minutes. This experience taught me the importance of perseverance and breaking down complex challenges into manageable pieces.

### Tell me About a Time You Showed Leadership?

Although I didn’t have a formal leadership title, I took the lead in mentoring junior engineers at Xyz. I helped them understand the intricacies of the ACH payments workflow and guided them through design reviews and pull requests. One specific instance was when I helped a junior engineer troubleshoot an issue with a microservice for exporting expense data. By providing guidance and offering insights, I empowered the team to deliver a more efficient solution, raising both their confidence and the quality of the output. My leadership style is collaborative, focused on mentoring and improving team productivity.

### Tell me About a Time You Solved a Problem?

At Xyz, I noticed that our system was processing duplicate expenses inefficiently, causing a significant backlog each month. I identified the problem by analyzing the expense settlement process and data patterns. I then developed an algorithm to automatically merge duplicate expenses, which reduced manual effort and streamlined the settlement process. This solution allowed us to handle over 8,000 duplicate expenses monthly. From this, I learned that by addressing core issues head-on and using data, we can create long-term scalable solutions.

### Tell me About What You Do for Fun Outside of Work?

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking and outdoor activities. I find that spending time in nature helps me recharge and reflect. I’m also passionate about reading, especially books on technology and leadership, and I actively participate in coding challenges to sharpen my skills. I enjoy the balance of physical and mental activities, which keeps me focused and energized in both my personal and professional life.
