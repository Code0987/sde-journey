### Can you describe the time when you had to solve a complex problem in your previous software development job?

This question is designed to assess a candidate’s problem-solving skills and ability to handle complex tasks.

Situation

- In my previous job, we were tasked to migrate a core expenses API from legacy systems to a new platform.
- The API had several complexities ~
  - Older API was internal while the new was open to the public.
  - The new API was already in use by the public partially, so it was necessary if any changes were made to the API contract, they had to be done in a backward compatible way or all of customers would have to migrate to the new API.
  - This whole migration was a big task, so meanwhile we had to maintain the old API.
  - All the updates were to be discussed with multiple teams.

Task

- My task was to figure out the backend changes.
- Communicate changes with multiple teams such as product, customer support and frontend and get a final agreement.
- Deliver the changes with no data damage during migration.
- Ensure while migration is going on, old API, old data remains in sync with new API.

Action

- To tackle this problem, I first conducted extensive research on the old API and studied all available documentation.
- I reached out to the engineers who had worked on this resource before for additional support and brainstorm solutions.
- We identified the inconsistencies in the data and built workarounds to address them.
- I also wrote detailed tests to ensure that the integration was working as intended.
- As soon as changes started going out, I ensured all the teams are on same page on what's coming up.

Result

- We were able to complete the task successfully, and the migration was smooth.
- The new API was a success, and we were able to maintain the old API while the new API was in use.
- When every customer was migrated to the new API, we were able to reduce the number of requests to the old API to 0 and finally eliminate the need for the old API.
- The new API was also 30x more performant than the old API, which was a significant improvement.

### Can you tell me about a time when you had a conflict with your colleague?

This question evaluates a candidate’s ability to work collaboratively and manage difficult interpersonal situations. An effective response should demonstrate the candidate’s communication skills, conflict resolution abilities, and ability to work effectively in a team.

Situation

- In my previous software engineering job, I had a conflict with a colleague over the best approach to solve a coding problem we were working on. My colleague had a different opinion than mine, and we couldn’t come to an agreement on the solution.

Task

- My task was to resolve the conflict with my colleague and find a solution that would work for both of us.

Action

- To resolve the conflict, I scheduled a meeting with my colleague to discuss the problem in detail.
- I made sure to listen actively to my colleague’s perspectives and ask questions to understand their reasoning better.
- Then, I explained my approach and the rationale behind it.
- We discussed the pros and cons of each approach and analysed the potential impact on the project’s timeline and deliverables.

Result

- In the end, we successfully implemented the solution, and it worked as intended.
- More importantly, the conflict with my colleague was resolved in a constructive and respectful manner.
- We also gained a better understanding of each other’s strengths and working styles, which helped us to collaborate more effectively on future projects.

### Can you describe a project that you have worked on that required you to learn a new programming language or technology? How did you approach the task of learning and applying the new skill?

This question assesses a candidate’s ability to adapt to new technologies and learn new skills. A strong answer should include details about the project, the new language or technology learned, and the candidate’s approach to learning the new skill.

### Can you me about the time you failed/mistake on a task and how you overcame it?

This behavioural question is asked to assess how a candidate deals with failures or mistakes in the workplace. Failure and making mistakes are inevitable in any job, and the ability to overcome them and learn from them is a critical skill. The interviewer wants to see how the candidate takes ownership of their mistakes, learns from them, and uses that knowledge to improve their work going forward.

Situation

- In my current job, I was working on a project that involved developing a new feature for an existing resource.
- I had been assigned to lead the development of this feature, and the project had a tight deadline.

Task

- My task was to develop the feature within the given timeline while ensuring that it met the quality standards and requirements of the project.

Action

- In the initial phase of the project, I spent a considerable amount of time researching and planning the development process. I discussed my ideas with my colleagues, sought feedback, and made changes to my approach based on their input.
- Despite my planning, I encountered a roadblock while implementing a critical feature.
- I realized that I had made an incorrect assumption about how a particular component of the system worked (advances).
- As a result, the feature was not working correctly, and the project was at risk of missing the deadline.
- To overcome this challenge, I took immediate ownership of my mistake and informed my colleagues and manager about the issue.
- I worked with my team to identify the root cause of the problem, and we brainstormed various solutions to resolve the issue.

Result

- In the end, we successfully resolved the issue, and the feature was completed on time and met the project’s quality standards.
- However, I also learned a valuable lesson from this experience — to double-check my assumptions and take the time to thoroughly understand the existing codebase before making changes.
- This experience also taught me the importance of collaboration and communication with my colleagues to overcome challenges in the development process.

### Can you tell me about a time when you were overwhelmed/went beyond your expectation?

This behavioural question is asked to assess how a candidate deals with stress, pressure, and unexpected challenges in the workplace. The interviewer wants to see how the candidate responds when they are faced with a demanding situation and whether they have the ability to manage their workload and prioritize tasks effectively.

Situation

- In my previous job, I was working on a feature that involved developing a new microservice. The microservice (pdf exports) had requirements which required me to work with a new technology that I was not familiar with.

Task

- My task was to design and implement the feature within a tight deadline while ensuring that it met the quality standards and requirements of the project.

Action

- To start, I spent considerable time researching the new technology and familiarizing myself with its capabilities.
- I also collaborated with my colleagues to gain additional insights and learn from their experiences.
- During the development process, I encountered several challenges that initially overwhelmed me.
- I broke down the project into smaller tasks, prioritized them based on their importance, and created a detailed plan of action to ensure that I was on track to meet the deadline.
- I also went above and beyond my assigned duties by proactively identifying and fixing several bugs in the existing codebase.
- This helped to improve the overall quality of the application and earned me recognition from my manager and colleagues.
