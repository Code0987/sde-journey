Problem Statement:
You are given an array A consisting of N integers. The elements of the array represent the strength of each link in a chain. Your task is to divide this chain into three smaller chains by breaking it at exactly two non-adjacent positions.

More precisely, you must break the chain at two positions P and Q such that:

0 < P < Q < N - 1

Q > P + 1 (i.e., the breaks must be non-adjacent)

After breaking the chain at positions P and Q, it will be split into three subchains:

A[0] to A[P - 1]

A[P + 1] to A[Q - 1]

A[Q + 1] to A[N - 1]

The cost of breaking the chain at positions P and Q is A[P] + A[Q].

Write a function:

def solution(A):

that takes an array A of integers and returns the minimum cost of dividing the chain into three pieces.


Example:

A = [5, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7]
Possible valid breaks:

Break at (1, 3): Cost = 2 + 6 = 8
Break at (1, 4): Cost = 2 + 3 = 5 ‚Üê (minimum)
Break at (2, 4): Cost = 4 + 3 = 7

So the function should return:
5


Constraints:
N will be at least 5
You must write an efficient algorithm to handle large inputs
